# Hello LiDAR (FEAT.RADAR) `r emo::ji("hand")`

---

# Summary

## LiDAR
 * **Light** Detection And Ranging
 * to measure and scan the return time by emitting millions of laser pulses per second
 * to create high-resolution models of ground elevation with a vertical accuracy of 10cm

# Summary

## LiDAR
.pull-left[
* High precision 
* Measure elevation and orientation accurately
* Detect temperature and object 
* Scan surroundings at night
]
 
.pull-right[ 
* High power consumption
* Not suitable for extensive navigation due to sensor limitations
* Highly influenced by the environment (e.g. humidity, snow, rain, fog etc.)
]


## RADAR
 * **RAdio** Detection And Ranging
 * to determine the distance, angle of objects relative to the site using radio waves
 * LiDAR and RADAR are used complementarily!

---

# Application

## LiDAR
 * Mounted on aircraft or satellites for precise geographical and environmental observations
 * a crackdown on motor vehicle speed violations
 * Laser scanner for 3D image restoration
 * 3D image sensor for driverless vehicles

## RADAR
 * Detects aircraft, ships, spacecraft, miles, cars, and terrain
 * Finding the depth of the deep sea 
 * Used for weather observation, emergency braking devices of vehicles and rear detection system

#### **Both** are most recently used in **self-driving car technology** `r emo::ji("car")`

# Reflection 

* Learning Lidar as one of the remote sensing data measuring devices, I was surprised as **we use cutting-edge technology in our daily lives.** For example, I thought it was used only for aerial photography, but even radio waves are used in microwave ovens!

* I am looking forward to how this technology, which is currently the core of autonomous vehicle development, will change our future. And I wish this technology could use as **a solution for climate change.**
