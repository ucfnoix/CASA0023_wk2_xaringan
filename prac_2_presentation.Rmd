# Hello LiDAR (feat.RADAR) `r emo::ji("hand")`

---

# Summary


## LiDAR

* **Light** Detection And Ranging
 * to measure and scan the return time by emitting millions of laser pulses per second
 * to create high-resolution models of ground elevation with a vertical accuracy of 10cm
* Usually compared with RADAR 


## RADAR
 * **RAdio** Detection And Ranging
 * to determine the distance, angle of objects relative to the site using radio waves


## Both are used complementarily!

# Summary

.pull-left[
* LiDAR can 
 * High precision 
 * Measure elevation and orientation accurately
 * Detect temperature and object 
 * Scan surroundings at night

.pull-right[
* Compared to RADAR, LiDAR is...
 * High power consumption
 * not suitable for extensive navigation due to sensor limitations
 * Highly influenced by the environment (e.g. humidity, snow, rain, fog etc.)

# Application

* **LiDAR**
 * Mounted on aircraft or satellites for precise geographical and environmental observations
 * a crackdown on motor vehicle speed violations
 * Laser scanner for 3D image restoration
 * 3D image sensor for driverless vehicles

* **RADAR**
 * Detects aircraft, ships, spacecraft, miles, cars, and terrain
 * Finding the depth of the deep sea 
 * Used for weather observation, emergency braking devices of vehicles and rear detection system

* **Both** are most recently used in **self-driving car technology** `r emo::ji("car")`

# Reflection 

.pull-left[

]
* Learning Lidar as one of the remote sensing data measuring devices, I was surprised as we use cutting-edge technology in our daily lives. For example, I thought it was used only for aerial photography, but even radio waves are used in microwave ovens!

* I am looking forward to how this technology, which is currently the core of autonomous vehicle development, will change our future. And I wish this technology could use as a solution for climate change.
