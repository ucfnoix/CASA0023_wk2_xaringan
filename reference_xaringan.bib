  abstract = {This paper will review the main sensor technologies used to create an autonomous vehicle. Sensors are key components for all types of autonomous vehicles because they can provide the data required to perceive the surrounding environment and therefore aid the decision-making process. This paper explains how each of these sensors work, their advantages and disadvantages and how sensor fusion techniques can be utilised to create a more optimum and efficient system for autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract = {We present a real-time algorithm which enables an autonomous car to comfortably follow other cars at various speeds while keeping a safe distance. We focus on highway scenarios. A velocity and distance regulation approach is presented that depends on the position as well as the velocity of the followed car. Radar sensors provide reliable information on straight lanes, but fail in curves due to their restricted field of view. On the other hand, Lidar sensors are able to cover the regions of interest in almost all situations, but do not provide precise speed information. We combine the advantages of both sensors with a sensor fusion approach in order to provide permanent and precise spatial and dynamical data. Our results in highway experiments with real traffic will be described in detail.},
